# hello-world
My first-ever programming repository.

Hello is appropriate, I suppose.

I've built a computer. Loaded it with Windows 7 (upgraded windows 10) and found that there should be improvements on the look and feel of a PC OS. 
This is my journey to learn how to code (starting with python) and maybe make my own operating system some day.
If successful, I plan on keeping it for myself - in a Tony-Stark sort of fashion - until it is perfect. Then I will sell it.


Good luck to myself.
